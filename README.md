# Budget Master

A tool that I'm building to quite honestly help my wife and I share our budget with each other.  In the process of brainstorming, I thought out ways to expand on the idead and allow it to scale up to allow other people use of the tool

# This is VERY much a work in progress

Future development goals:
Storing a budget in MySQL,
All buttons functionality through JavaScript and jQuery,
Improve the design and appearance,
Full backend development with Node.js,
Log in authentication with Firebase and Passport.js
